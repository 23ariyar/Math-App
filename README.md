# Math-App

### Pods
Currently, we use pods for firebase logins and without it the code will fail to run due to its usage in the code. Hereâ€™s how to install this dependency
 
1. Open terminal (directory does not matter)
2. run this command: sudo gem install cocoapods
    - if this does not work try the following steps:
    - /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    - brew cleanup -d -v
    - brew install cocoapods
    - brew link cocoapods

3. move to do the directory of your project through this command: cd /Your/Path/Here/Math-App
4. run this command: Pod install
5. Within the Math-App folder, there should be a new item called Test3.xcworkspace. Only open this to run and edit the app on XCode

_Note that there are some features that XCode does not allow to be run on a simulator_
_(saving a screenshot to your camera roll) and there are some features that cannot be run on an iPad._
_This is both either due to safety concerns or due to not having access to the premium version (which is so stupid). So you can attribute some errors to this._
